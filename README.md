# Server-Farm-Delaunay-Triangulation

The repository contains the capability needed to evaluate components of the hydrologic properties of a server farm construction site. For an aleatory number of points, a Delaunay Triangulation is used to find the elevation point of a point given its planar location, the Euclidian minimum spanning tree of the sample points, and other things.
